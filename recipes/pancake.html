                <p>A pancake is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter. It is a type of batter bread.</p>

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flour: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
                    <li>Baking powder: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.</li>
                    <li>Sugar: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li>
                    <li>Salt: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</li>
                    <li>Milk and butter: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</li>
                    <li>Egg: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.</li>


                </ul>
