    <p>A hamburger or simply burger is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>1 egg</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon mustard (regular or Dijon)</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
       <li>1 small onion, finely grated</li>
       <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
       <li>1⁄2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1⁄2 teaspoon pepper</li>
    <li>1 lb medium ground beef</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Lightly oil grill& heat BBQ to medium.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg in a bowl& add next 6 ingredients.</li>
        <li>Add any of the “stir-ins” that appeal to you.</li>
        <li>Crumble in beef& using your hands or a fork, gently mix together.</li>
        <li>Handle the meat as little as possible – the more you work it, the tougher it gets.</li>
        <li>Gently shape (don’t firmly press) mixture into burgers about ¾ inch thick.</li>
        <li>Using your thumb, make a shallow depression in the centre of each burger to prevent puffing up during cooking.</li>
        <li>Place burgers on the grill, close lid& BBQ until NO LONGER PINK INSIDE, turning once, about 6 – 8 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>An instant read thermometer should read 160F.</li>
        <li>Don't abuse your burgers by pressing with a spatula, pricking with a fork or turning frequently as precious juices will be lost!</li>
        <li>Tuck into a warm crusty bun& add your favourite toppings.</li>

    </ol>
